/**
 * Normalized token usage. The CONTRACT every adapter must respect when mapping its upstream usage
 * (each transport uses different names: `usage`, `usageMetadata`, `meta`...):
 *
 *  - `completionTokens` INCLUDES the reasoning/thinking tokens (they are not separate).
 *  - `totalTokens === promptTokens + completionTokens` (invariant).
 *  - `reasoningTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, and `cacheWriteTokens` are OPTIONAL details and SUBSETS
 *    (reasoning of completion; read/write of prompt); they are not added to the total.
 *  - `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` are disjoint from each other; both are INCLUDED in
 *    `promptTokens`. If an upstream reports them separately (Anthropic), the adapter ADDS them to the prompt.
 *
 * If the upstream separates reasoning from the visible output, the adapter adds them into
 * `completionTokens`. The cost calc and budgets depend on this semantics.
 * Use `isUsageConsistent` in tests/dev to verify it.
