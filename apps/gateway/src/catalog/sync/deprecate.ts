 * `deprecated: true` - metadata only, `operations`/`pricing` are never touched (deprecating a built-in
 * model must not change what any existing deployment resolves to on next restart). The patched entry is
 * only a report suggestion; nothing is written to any catalog.
 *
 * Gated on BOTH existence sources having had a `complete` fetch this run: a partial/failed fetch must
 * never read as "the model is gone," or a source outage would mass-flag the catalog. Models with no
 * confirmed-sighting in the history (hand-curated, provider-exclusive models never listed on either
 * aggregator) are never flagged - the trigger requires prior tracking.
