/**
 * Runs each integration test file in its OWN `bun test` process.
 *
 * Integration tests use a real Postgres and Redis through the shared app singletons and are written
 * for per-file isolation (one process each, the way `node --test` ran them). `bun test` runs every
 * file in a single shared process, which lets one file's connections and state leak into the next —
 * so we spawn one `bun test` per file here. The runner also invokes a separate cleanup process before
 * and after each file, so interrupted or failed test processes do not leave fake public models in the
 * operator database. Exits non-zero if any file or cleanup fails.
